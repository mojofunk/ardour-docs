# Development Summary (5.8..5.9)

Version 5.9 has been tagged so this is an updated summary of the changes since 5.8.

Some significant optimizations were made to redraw performance on OS X/macOS that may be apparent if you are using Ardour on that platform.
 
There were further improvements to tempo and MIDI related features and lots of small improvements to state serialization.

Support for the Faderport8 control surface was added, see the manual for some quite thorough documentation: http://manual.ardour.org/using-control-surfaces/PreSonus_FaderPort8/

There were also many smaller but by no means less significant fixes and improvements.
