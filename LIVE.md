What changes to Ardour would be required to make it more suitable or effective
as a live performance tool and for loop based composition style workflow.

These should all eventually have references to bug reports associated with
them.

# Recording

Track controls like record, solo, mute etc need to be able to be automated to
occur at bar/beat boundaries or perhaps queue until locate occurs etc

# Editor

Muting regions using the mouse using a Mute Tool and or a key when mouse cursor
is over a region/event or a region selection

Tools for manipulation of automation data at snap intervals for cutter/gapper
type effects.

Create range selection and add automation points at snap-to setting?

# Transport and Looping

An important part of live performance is being able to easily manipulate loop
points.

Be able to audition while transport is rolling to control outs/headphones. Also
being able to audition in sync to tempo bars/beats/

# Samples and Instruments

UI design that supports fast access to audio files/samples, instruments and
supports drag and drop. Ableton live gets many things right in this area it
seems...describe what they are.

# Controllers

A more discoverable way of binding a midi event to a control in additiong to
the current method of binding a midi event to a controller of CTRL and middle
mouse click

The location window might be a good place to allow binding controls for loop
ranges.

Add support for a specific external controller such as an android or iOS
application?

# Effects

What improvements can be made to bind controllers to effect parameters
