# Purpose

This repository is intended to store personal notes and documentation relating
to Ardour.

Information may not be correct, most of it is based on my subjective opinion
and is not meant to be useful for others. Any information I consider to be
important will generally make its way into the official Ardour bug tracker, git
repository, manual, mail archives etc. 

# Conventions

File and directory names are all lower case with a hyphen between words

All documentation is written using Markdown
