# Library dependencies

## Requirements

Build the entire library stack with the same compiler and compile options.

Build the application against installed system libraries

Build the application against self compiled libraries

Upstream library dependencies use a variety of different build systems and
tools.

Ardour currently builds every dependency from source for the builds it
distributes apart from the c and c++ libraries.
