# Issue Tracking

# Issue Triage

## Duplicate Issues

If an new issue is found to be a duplicate then it should be marked as such and
closed so that the original issue is the only communication channel regarding
the issue.

# Issue States

Mantis issue status descriptions from the
[manual](http://www.mantisbt.org/manual/admin.lifecycle.status.html)

All reports start with there status set to 'new'. A developer will then usually
set the bug status to either acknowledged, feedback or confirmed.

## Acknowledged

For a bug report the acknowledged state means the developer has at least read
the report and does not require any more information from the reporter.

For a feature request this status is used by the development team to reflect
their agreement to the suggested feature request.

## Feedback

Feedback means a developer needs more information from the reporter, perhaps
asking for specific version, platform, additional steps to reproduce etc. For a
feature request it may mean that more information/design input is required.

## Confirmed

Confirmed means a developer has enough information from the reporter and can
reproduce the issue. For a feature request it means that the feature is
confirmed and the 'Target Version' field should be set.

## Assigned

Means a particular developer is working on the issue.

## Resolved

When an issue is resolved it is set to the resolved state. If a particular
commit resolves the issue it should be identified.

## Closed

An issue that is closed can not be edited or commented on so only
developers/admin should set bugs to this state. It should be used for old bugs
that are no longer relevant.
