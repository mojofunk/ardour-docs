    <title>Test Cases</title>
    <para>
      Test Cases for checking that functionality in Ardour is working as
      expected.
    </para>

    <para>
      These Test Cases include images of the expected user interface
      elements that are used for interaction during the tests. These may
      vary slightly on different platforms so that should be indicated or
      accounted for if there are major differences(with different reference
      images)
    </para>

    <para>
      Having reference images of the user interface while performing the
      Tests will make it easier to understand the expected result. It can
      also be used to indicate when the user interface has been changed and
      the test cases and perhaps sections in the manual/guides need to be
      updated.
