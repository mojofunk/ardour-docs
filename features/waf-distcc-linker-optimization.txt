I'm involved developing an application that uses waf that takes about 30 minutes to build on my machine(from cold ccache)
It builds about a dozen shared libraries and the application
I have been experimenting lately with using distcc to speed it up a bit.
I was wondering if there is a way for waf to start the linker for a particular library straight after the object files have been compiled while the other threads continue compiling other libraries etc
At the moment using distcc I can compile all the source files in about 8 minutes but then it takes roughly 2 minute to then link
My thinking is that if I can get the local machine to link the libraries while the "build slaves" continue there work I will have a faster build.
If you think I've made any wrong assumptions please correct me.
I have tried to use build groups but quickly realized that they wouldn't help me(unless I'm using them wrongly)
I use ccache which helps alot but I also often swap between many different branches, a native linux build and a cross compiled build for windows etc so it would be nice if there was something I could try that I may have overlooked
We are using version 1.6.11 if that makes any difference to my inquiry
